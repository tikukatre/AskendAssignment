## Environment Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set up your environment variables:

1. In the root directory of the backend project, you'll find a file named `.env.example`.

2. Create a new file in the same directory and name it `.env`.

3. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.

4. Fill in the values in the `.env` file with your specific configuration details.
